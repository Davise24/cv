      <p>I am a <strong><a href="https://online.husson.edu/">Husson University graduate.</a></strong> Bit relatively late with the with a
        passion for the airlines, I switched my focus in about 2015 from Marketing
        communications (my major) to a full on career in ground in ground operations
        at the airport. I excelled, and not only that, I loved the work, but moving
        back east there were less job oppurtunites and the ones available were based
        in attrition...I hit a wall, which lead to my 4th professional career switch
        in coding.</p></td>
